## Team Members:

## Project description: 
The objective of this project is to create a RoboAdvisor that returns the best token-pair between different decentralized exchanges (DEX), allowing the users to find opportunities on the various price differences, so they can convert or swap tokens (using flash loans) maximizing the profit.
We will be getting live data using API keys, we will use AWS by storing data in S3, we will use Amazon Lex to build the RoboAdvisor and Lambda to store and run the code.

## Datasets to be used:
* [AWS Management Console]
* [app.uniswap.org]
* [aave.com]

## Rough breakdown of tasks:
* Obtain data from different app 
* Store data in S3
* Create RodoAdvisor with different utterances, Lambda initialization and validation, and several slots
* Create and run code in Lambda
